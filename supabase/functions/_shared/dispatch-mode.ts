/**
 * T2.8 dry dispatch mode.
 *
 * This module deliberately has no CALL-E URL, key, or fetch dependency. The
 * live dispatcher hands it the already-serialized body, so dry mode can prove
 * exactly what it would have sent while being structurally unable to dial.
 *
 * The body a dry run records is a masked copy of those bytes. The exact body
 * carries the webhook secret and the callee's full number, and the run's owner
 * may read the recorded row.
 *
 * The recorded fixtures below are embedded rather than read from `testdata/`. A
 * deployed Edge Function bundles only the function directory, so a runtime read
 * of `testdata/` fails in production. A test in this module pins both recorded
 * copies against the committed files, so the two cannot drift apart without a
 * failure. The third rehearsal shape is the completed recording with CALL-E's
 * validation-failure status and no extract, and its own test pins that
 * derivation.

 * implementation, by design, so it cannot dial.
 *
 * The `dispatched` row records a masked copy of the would-be body rather than
 * the body itself. The exact body carries the webhook secret inside its
 * `webhook_url` and the callee's full number, and `call_events` is readable by
 * the run's owner. The mask keeps the shape an operator reads and redacts only
 * those two values. `requestBody` comes back unchanged, so the dispatcher can
 * still compare the rehearsed bytes against what a live dispatch sends.
 *
 * Ordering: the terminal row is written first, then the dispatch is recorded,
 * then the fixture is ingested, then finalisation is recorded. Recording
 * `dispatched` before the write would leave a timeline entry for a dispatch
 * that never durably happened. The ingestion path sets `completed_at` inside
 * its transaction, so the terminal write alone never reads as a finished run.
