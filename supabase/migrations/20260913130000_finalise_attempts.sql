-- T2.7a bounds the finaliser's work on a terminal run.
--
-- A terminal run whose re-fetch or ingestion kept failing was retried by every
-- tick forever. Twenty such runs filled the whole twenty row batch, so a fresh
-- run never finalised. The finaliser now spends a limited number of attempts
-- on a run and waits between them.
--
-- `finalise_attempts` counts the failed attempts. `finalise_after` is the
-- earliest time the tick may select the run again, and the tick skips the run
-- until that time passes. `finalise_error` keeps the last error on the run, so
-- an operator reads why the finaliser is still working on it.
--
-- Two give-up paths end a run by setting `completed_at` outside ingestion, and
-- each names its reason on the timeline. This migration owns the columns and
-- the two SQL boundaries those paths use.

comment on column public.call_runs.finalise_attempts is
  'Failed finaliser attempts for this run. The finaliser ends the run when the attempt limit is spent.';

comment on column public.call_runs.finalise_after is
  'Earliest time the finaliser may select this run again. Null means no attempt has failed. The tick skips the run until this time passes.';

comment on column public.call_runs.finalise_error is
  'The last error a finalise attempt reported. The give-up path repeats it on the timeline. A completed run keeps an error here only when its final timeline row was lost.';

-- One failed attempt, recorded atomically with the wait that follows it. The
-- run row is locked, so two ticks cannot double count one attempt. The caller
-- reads `attempts` to decide whether the limit is spent.
--
-- A concurrent ingest may finish the run while an attempt fails. Counting an
-- attempt on a finished run would report work nobody owes, so the count and the
-- wait are skipped there.
